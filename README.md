She Need Smo.re
===============
A simple web-accessing app for admin on a YunoHost instance.

This is an app that gives you admin access to
your YunoHost instance for ease of use
(e.g.: with a freeview window while using browser). It will give access to your YunoHost admin panel and keep you logged in for 1-tap-access. It also has a button to go to your preferred DNS-provider for when you're adding domains.

It will ask for your default YunoHost domain and
the URL of your preferred DNS-provider on first boot,
which can then be changed at a later time in its settings.

##This app assumes you did NOT change your
default YunoHost adminpanel URL!
(/yunohost/admin/).

Occasional test-builds will be provided
and can be used instead of compiling it yourself.

The name of the app is derived from
the YunoHost instance it was first made for.
